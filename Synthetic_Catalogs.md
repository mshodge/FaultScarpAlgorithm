# Read Me for Synthetic Catalogs

16 synthetic catalogs have been uploaded to the zip file 'Synthetic_Catalogs_data.zip'. All profiles are 400 m long. All have an randomised upper and lower slope between 0 and 5 degrees.

# No Noise Catalogs (NN)

Profiles only contain breaks in slope from the fault scarp. All scarp values are given in the file 'Synthetic_Catalog_Parameters.xlsx'.

# Noisy Catalogs (NN)

Profiles contain noise from vegetation, hills and ditches. Also the fault scarp has been degraded. Here the number of vegetation features is randomised to be between 1 and 20. The height of the vegetation is randomised between 1 and 3 meters, and the width between 1 and 3 meters. The location along the profile is also random (and can fall on the scarp). There is a 50% chance a profile has a hill, and a 10% chance it has two hills. The height and the width of the hill is between 3 and 10 meters, and 8 and 15 meters, respectively. The odds, height and width of the ditches is the same (i.e., 50% for one). The scarp is degraded by a diffusion constant (kappa) randomised between 1 and 5 m^2/kyr for each profile, and the degredation time is randomised between 0 and 10 kyr. All values are given in the file 'Synthetic_Catalog_Parameters.xlsx'.
